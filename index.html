    <h1>The best movies according to Nathan James D Agpalza</h1>
    <h2>My top 10 movies of all time</h2>
    <hr/>
<h3>Mother of flies</h3>
    <p>“Mother of Flies,” about a father and daughter who get tangled up with a faith healer in a remote woodland area, is a family movie, but not in the way the phrase is usually used. It’s a nightmare parable about mortality, grief, faith, and the fragility of the flesh, made by one of the most fascinating filmmaking teams in American cinema, the Adams-Poser family.

The operation consists of four people: the father, John Adams, and the Mother, Toby Poser, both actors, and their daughters, Lulu and Zelda Adams. They direct, write, edit, and shoot as a team while they’re performing on camera. I have only seen a couple of their many films, “The Deeper You Dig” and “Hellbender.” Both struck me more or less as this one did: not quite my jam, for reasons that might not matter to other people, but clearly the product of talented people who’ve formed a hive-mind. </p>
<h3>Return to silent hill</h3>
    <p>Should you rewatch “Silent Hill,” the exceptionally good live-action 2006 video game adaptation, before checking out “Return to Silent Hill,” a narratively unrelated sequel based on the popular “Silent Hill 2” game? Yes and no, though for the same reason: the first “Silent Hill” movie, a creepy and atmospheric mood piece directed by the still largely unsung journeyman Christophe Gans (“Brotherhood of the Wolf”), holds up really well. </p>
<h3>H is for hawk</h3>
    <p>In the wake of her father’s sudden death in 2007, the English academic Helen Macdonald turned to training a goshawk, attempting to stave off depression by subsuming her grief in a relationship with a bird of prey—not just any bird but one considered notoriously difficult to train, even for trained falconers. But the goshawk’s fierce, unpredictable nature spoke to something wild in Macdonald’s own temperament, to her impulsive and perhaps self-destructive desire to withdraw from civilization, taking solace in the natural world and its primordial ways. </p>
<h3>In cold light</h3>
    <p>You don’t expect melancholy blue-mood ambiance in a fast-paced thriller, and this gives “In Cold Light” an emotional foundation it might not otherwise have. The film starts with a woman being chased by the cops; she barely stops running for the entire film, yet there’s this deep, quiet intensity underneath it all. Directed by Maxime Giroux, the film rarely lets up, but it is interested in character and environment, in mood and emotion, not just plot.</p>
<h3>Mercy</h3>
    <p>The “screenlife” technique of telling a story entirely or primarily through desktop and laptop visuals has been put to effective use in films such as “Unfriended” (2014), “Host” (2020) and “Missing” (2023), as well as in a batch of TV series, e.g., the clever and innovative “Connection Lost” episode of “Modern Family” in 2015. (We also got a spate of mostly forgettable screenlife films and streaming series during the pandemic.)

Full download disclosure: I feel like the gimmick is played out at this point—and by the halfway mark of the screen-popping and kinetic but ultimately tiresome and borderline dopey AI thriller “Mercy,” I found myself yearning for a wireless mouse so I could log off. 
</p>
<h3>Night Patrol</h3>
    <p>Writer-director Ryan Prows‘ “Night Patrol,” a cop corruption thriller that’s also a vampire movie, has a sprawling cast, but focuses on four characters. There’s Ethan Hawkins (Justin Long), the son of a legendary LAPD cop (Dermot Mulroney), who wants to join The Night Patrol, an unofficial, secretive, elite unit within the department that’s essentially a vampire street gang with badges and uniforms. Ethan’s partner, Xavier Carr (Jermaine Fowler), is a Black patrolman who used to be a member of the Crips gang and hopes to rise through the ranks of the police and become somebody who gives orders as well as takes them. Xavier’s brother, Wazi Carr (RJ Cyler), is a Crips-affiliated petty criminal who sleeps on a bare mattress at his mama’s house. He’s in shock over secretly witnessing an LAPD officer murdering someone close to him, and fears a Night Patrol member will kill him to prevent him from testifying about what he saw.</p>
<h3>Kidnapped: Elizabeth smart</h3>
    <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, we had a series of high-profile child-abduction and child-murder cases, from Jaycee Dugard to JonBen&#233;t Ramsey, from Polly Klaas to Caylee Anthony to the Cleveland captives Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus. Each of these stories received breathless, national coverage, fueled by the emerging dominance of tabloid TV and the 24-hour cable cycle. (Cases involving missing or murdered minority children—and teens and young adults—were largely ignored, leading the late great journalist Gwen Ifill to coin the term “Missing White Women Syndrome.”)</p>
<h3>The big fake</h3>
    <p>Have you ever been in a bind where you needed two signatures on a document to get by, and you were the only person in the room? If so, then you may have firsthand experience that forgery, or attempted forgery, can be something of a lark, something of a game. 

And, of course, it became a game with consequences. In “The Big Fake,” a new fiction film directed by Stefano Lodovichi from a script by Lorenzo Bagnotori and Sandro Petraglia, an aspiring artist named Toni, who has generous flowing black hair and beard and piercing blue eyes (he’s played by Pietro Castellitto), discovers that he can duplicate a Modigliani painting perfectly, right down to the signature. It soon follows that there’s money in it. There’s also money to be made forging signatures on large checks.</p>
<h3>Clicka</h3>
    <p>Many musical biopics are essentially rags-to-riches stories, a parable about how hard work and talent with the right lucky break can make the big time. Michael Greene’s “Clika” follows in the tried and true footsteps of this still-growing genre but falls far short of becoming a headliner. The movie is a fictitious tale of an artist named Chito (JayDee, the frontman of Herencia de Patrones) who carries around a notebook of song ideas that he adds to in between picking peaches in his hometown of Yuba City, California, and making music with friends. When his family’s home is foreclosed on by the bank, Chito steps up his efforts to make it in the music business and branches out to work with his uncle, trafficking drugs, making the kind of money he never knew possible. </p>
<h3>The moment</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 2024, it seemed impossible to escape the neon slime color and lowercase text of Charli xcx’s sixth studio album, Brat. For a movie about the feel-good party season that never seemed to end, Charli and director Aidan Zamiri have taken a rather different approach than the traditional concert film featuring behind-the-scenes snippets of tour life and rehearsals leading up to a big show in front of waves of screaming fans. “The Moment” is something different, a big swing into the mockumentary genre satirizing the pressures of pop stardom and the struggle for creative control. It doesn’t always work, but Charli xcx, as ever, throws a wild party. </p>
